Hades GeeCON sample
-------------------

This is the sample app to demo Hades features at GeeCON 2010. The two main packages to take a look at are org.geecon.hades.before and org.geecon.hades.after. The first one shows a typical data access implementation with JPA 2. The second one shows what's left if you use Hades.
